on the master branch please find the parsers for both FASTA and FASTQ. positive and negative test cases are built into these files under seq 98 and 99 (positive and negative cases respectively) for both the fasta and fastq parsers. I did not use the template provided because it was easier for me to conceptualize how to code this project by starting from a blank slate.
